# Vulnerability-Scanning
With this project, I will show you how to use Zenmap and Wireshark to analyze a networks topology, audit systems, and scan for vulenerabilities.

### Overview

Cybersecurity is a broad field with lots of topics to study on yet one of the most important things you can do, is know your network.

Here we will show you how to utilize simple tools that will help you get a grasp on your security.

### Tasks

A.  Describe the network topology you found when running Nmap. Include screenshots as evidence of running Nmap.


B.  Summarize the vulnerabilities on the network and their potential implications based on your Nmap results.


C.  Describe the anomalies you found when running Wireshark, on the network capture file, and include evidence of the range of packets associated with each  anomaly.


D.  Summarize the potential implications of not addressing each  of the anomalies found when running Wireshark.


E.  Recommend solutions for eliminating or minimizing all identified vulnerabilities or anomalies from Wireshark and Nmap. Use current, industry-respected, reliable research and sources to support your recommendations for each vulnerability or anomaly.


F.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.


G.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
